# Skeleton App

Simple React skeleton app to be used in projects.

## What does it have?

- ⚛️React using Javascript
- 📦Webpack and Babel to bundle up everything
- 🖥React component with CSS module
- ✅Testing with Jest & Enzyme

## What does it do?

- **start** - Starts development server with hot code reload
- **test** - runs tests once
- **test:watch** - runs test in watch mode
- **build** - bundles up application

## Why?

I needed to learn how to setup a project but also wanted a lean and reusable piece that doesn't go for complex boilerplates that add unnecessary libraries.
